<h1>Clamshell Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Thank you for using Clamshell app! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle
information when you use Clamshell. Even though we don't collect any personal
data, we believe in transparency and want to assure you that your privacy
is important to us.

<h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>

We do not collect any of the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Personal identification details (such as name, address, phone number, or email)</li>
    <li>Financial information (such as credit card numbers)</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>IP addresses</li>
    <li>Cookies or tracking data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Do We Still Need a Privacy Policy?</h2>

<h3>1. Legal Expectations</h3>
While it's not legally required for us to have a Privacy Policy when no
personal data is collected, legal authorities may still expect to see one. By
providing a clear policy stating that no personal data is collected, we
demonstrate our commitment to transparency and compliance.

<h3>2. User Expectations</h3>
Users expect to find a Privacy Policy when using an app. Having one builds
trust and credibility. Even if we don't collect data, users appreciate knowing
how their privacy is respected.

<h3>3. Future Growth</h3>
As our app evolves, we may introduce new features or collect data.
If any data collection occurs in the future, we will promptly update this Privacy Policy.
